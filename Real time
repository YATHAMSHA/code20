Procedure: 
1. Setting up Blynk App 
Click on new project and click on home screen 
From Widget Box select Switch  
Now click on switch to change settings 
Select the pin u need to connect with the switch  
Click on execute button on right top 
App is ready to operate. The error symbol will be cleared when we upload code using node mcu and relay module after getting connected. 
 
 
2. Connecting Interfacing Relay and Node MCU 
Relay has 3 pin voltage (VCC) , Ground (GND) , Input Pin (IN) 
Connect VCC relay module to 3x3 of Node MCU 
Connect GND of relay module to GND of Node 
MCU 
Connect IN of relay module to digital pin of Node MCU 
3. Write code in Arduino IDE and upload the code 
4. Launch Application 
Connect 2 pin plug and holder on either sides of the electrical wire 
Disconnect one of the electrical wire in the circuit in-between 
These two ends of the voltage end of relay 
Connect one in the middle and other on either left/right 

Code:
#define BLYNK_PRINT Serial 
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h> #include<BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h> 
char auth[] = "zUbQNauhe5934OxsVFFPmbMQK5N-5JM9"; 
// ID to connect blynk app 
char ssid[] = "Redmi K20";
//Wifi name of the device 
char pass[] = "1*2@304856789";
//Wifi name of device to connect node mcu with Wifi 
void setup() 
{ 
  Serial.begin(9600); 
  Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass); 
} 
void loop() 
{ 
  Blynk.run();  
}
